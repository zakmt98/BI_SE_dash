The management services are organized as a platform that encompasses a plurality of underlying individual services each having an applications programming interface (API) that are together securely accessible via an API gateway. The gateway is configured to support a “browsable” directory of the APIs that enables a client to identify various underlying services available within the cluster. In an embodiment, the underlying services “self-register” at the gateway to provide a single, unified location for the client to access the services. The API gateway includes a reverse-proxy server that is configured to provide a single point of entry for clients interacting with the individual services underlying the management services platform. User authorization and authentication security are implemented at the API gateway rather than on the underlying services.\\n'}\n",
